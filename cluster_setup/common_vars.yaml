# the --disable servicelb is because the integrated load balancer does not allocate also virtual IPs. 
# So I prefer to use metallb
# I prefer to deploy traefik manually to have more control over it. And probably without a load balancer,
# we will also have problems with the proxy deployment.
# K3s is using flannel as CNI.
# Flannel default network is not enrcypted. So the communication between the pods is unencrypted. 
# There are experimental backend that supports [encryption](https://github.com/flannel-io/flannel/blob/master/Documentation/backends.md).
# We can activate it in [k3s](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/network-options/#flannel-options),
# I had problems when I activated the ipsec. The communication between the nodes did not work
# So I am now testing with wireguard
# The last 4 parameters are for exposing the metrics from the cluster
